*Reupload of Let's Certify project code*
Let's Certify is a browser plugin that provides safety checks on a URL to ensure it is safe for the user to browse 
which makes use of an RSA accumulator to securely store the website's information for quick retrieval in the event of a security update.
My contributions to the project were the development of the RSA Accumulator in python code as well as some additional coding
for the browser plugin, largely translating the python code into Javascript.
